Created a Landing Website using HTML and CSS.
Creating a landing website using HTML and CSS involves structuring the content and styling it to create an appealing and functional web page that encourages users to take a specific action, such as signing up for a service or learning more about a product. Below, I'll provide a detailed description of how you could go about creating a simple landing page using HTML and CSS.

1. Project Setup: Start by creating a new project folder on your computer. Inside this folder, you can create two separate files: index.html for the HTML structure and styles.css for the CSS styling.
HTML File-> index.html
CSS File-> Assets-> style.css
Javascript File-> Assets-> index.html
All Images are uploaded in Assets Folder.
Final Steps: Save the HTML and CSS files in the same project folder.
Open the index.html file in a web browser to see your landing page.
Fine-tune the styles and content as needed until you achieve the desired look and feel.
